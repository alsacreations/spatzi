  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Select your base colors:</strong> Use the "Background Color" and
      "Text Color" pickers (or type directly into the text fields) to choose
      your initial colors. Accepted formats include keywords (e.g.,
      "rebeccapurple"), OKLCH, HEX, RGB, or HSL.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Observe the "Base Color" box:</strong> This box displays your
      chosen background color. You'll see its representation in both OKLCH and
      sRGB HEX. Below, the WCAG and APCA contrast ratios against your chosen
      text color are shown.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Explore variations with OKLCH sliders:</strong> Adjust the
      "Lightness" (L), "Chroma" (C), and "Hue" (H) sliders. These sliders modify
      the <strong>background color</strong> to create a new variant.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Check the "Variant Color" box:</strong> This box shows the color
      generated by the LCH sliders. Like the base color, it displays OKLCH and
      sRGB HEX values, along with its contrast ratios against your chosen text
      color.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mind the gamut:</strong> If a chosen or generated OKLCH color is
      outside the sRGB gamut (the range of colors most screens can reliably
      display), a warning "(closest sRGB color)" will appear next to its HEX
      representation. The HEX value shown is the closest color within the sRGB
      gamut.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility insights:</strong> The WCAG and APCA values help you
      ensure your color combinations are accessible. Aim for sufficient
      contrast, especially for text.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Why <abbr title="Oklab Lightness Chroma Hue">OKLCH</abbr>?</h2>
  <p>
    The OKLCH color space offers many advantages over other color spaces in CSS.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Extended gamut:</strong> OKLCH can represent all displayable
      colors on modern screens with a wide color range, which is not the case
      with sRGB (RGB, HSL) which is more limited.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Uniform perception:</strong> OKLCH is based on how the human eye
      actually perceives colors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Intuitive manipulation:</strong> unlike RGB or hexadecimal
      notation, parameters for hue, lightness, and contrasts are intuitive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Better hue preservation</strong> during transitions or gradients.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Precise contrast control:</strong> The lightness component (L)
      directly corresponds to perceived brightness, making it easier to create
      accessible contrasts.
    </li>
